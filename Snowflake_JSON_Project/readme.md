# üìò Working with JSON Data in Snowflake

This project demonstrates how to handle and parse semi-structured **JSON data** using Snowflake. It includes setting up required schemas, creating file formats, using AWS S3 external stages, flattening array structures, and loading structured data into integration tables.

## üß± Features

- ‚úÖ Create database and schema structure
- ‚úÖ Define file format for JSON data
- ‚úÖ Create external stage for AWS S3
- ‚úÖ Load raw JSON data into staging tables
- ‚úÖ Parse nested and array JSON elements
- ‚úÖ Flatten array fields using `FLATTEN()`
- ‚úÖ Store final structured data in integration tables

---

## üìÅ Dummy JSON Data Example

Create a file named `dummy data.json` with the following content and upload it to your S3 bucket:

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "Ali",
    "Gender": "Male",
    "DOB": "1990-01-01",
    "Pets": ["Cat", "Dog", "Parrot"],
    "Address": {
      "House Number": "123",
      "City": "Lahore",
      "State": "Punjab"
    },
    "Phone": {
      "Work": 423456789,
      "Mobile": 3001234567
    }
  }
]
